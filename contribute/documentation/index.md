title: Contribute to Documentation
---
Documentation is the simplest lifeline any user has to understand how something works or how to use it. Please help out by creating new documentation or improving existing documentation.

Contributions to the documentation for Elision are accepted in the same manner as code contributions. Fork the repo, branch from the `gh-pages` branch, make your changes and submit a pull request.

## Looking for documentation to update?
Review the issues list for specific requests or known issues or browse the current documentation and look for pages that are missing, features that aren't described very well, etc.

## General Guidance
1. Rebase before submitting a pull request
1. Issue separate pull requests for different sections of the docs (i.e. avoid really big commits that cross logical boundaries in the docs).
