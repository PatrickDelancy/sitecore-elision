title: Code Conventions
---
As a general rule, follow the coding conventions that are already in place on the file you are editing. Here are some general recommendations:

We follow the coding conventions described in [this document](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2005/01/26/361363.aspx), with the following exceptions:

* Opening braces are on the same line as the statement that begins the block.
* It is OK to omit the braces for single-line conditionals, including the else block, as long as both are only one statement each.
* Using directives appear before the namespace, not inside it.
* Private fields are prefixed with an underscore and camel-cased.
