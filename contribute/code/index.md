title: Contribute to the Code
---
There is no doubt that this framework can be improved and expanded. Here is some guidance for contributing your own awesomeness to the product. We actively encourage people to contribute new features as well as refactor existing code!

## Dev Environment
* Visual Studio 2012, will be updating to 2015 soon
  * Community/Free edition should be fine
* .NET Framework version to match the version Sitecore requires (currently 4.5.1 as of Sitecore 8.0 Update 5)

## Making Changes
_Before you start_, post a message or issue on the Github repo. Describe your proposed changes and check that they fit with what others are doing and have planned for the project.


## General Guidance
1. Rebase before submitting a pull request
1. Contact one of the project owners _before_ doing any large refactoring. We may have some sage advice to get you going, or there may be a good reason your idea hasn't already been implemented.
1. Follow the established [coding conventions]({{ "./code-conventions/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

## Have an idea for a new feature?
1. Check the existing issues and feature requests to see if it is already planned or being worked on
1. Post a new issue to Github describing your requirements.
1. If you already have an implementation, submit a pull request.

## Found a bug?
1. Check the existing issues to see if it has already been reported.
1. Submit a new issue describing the bug and steps to reproduce.
1. If you already have a fix, submit a pull request to be considered.

## Looking for something to do?
1. Check the current issues list. If something is unassigned, then it should be up for grabs.
1. Choose a feature and do a code review. There's always room for improvement!
1. Write some unit tests.
