Elision was created by the CMS team at [DEG](http://www.degdigital.com/) to support the work that they do as a digital agency and Sitecore partner.

All of the initial internal releases were written and supported by [Patrick Delancy](http://patrickdelancy.com/), Jeff Rondeau and Aaron Ladage. After successfully using the framework on a number of client projects, they decided to release it as an open-source project in order to help the community and solicit more contributions.

Please also read about all of the [contributors]({{ "/contributors" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to Elision.
