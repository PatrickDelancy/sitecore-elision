## Install Elision for a New Project
Installing Elision is very simple.

1. Get the correct file from the [downloads page]({{ "/download" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
1. Open Sitecore's Update Installation Wizard ( http://[server]/sitecore/UpdateInstallationWizard.aspx )
1. Upload the Elision install package, analyze and install.

_NOTE_: Since Elision extends some core templates and functionality, some warnings are expected from the package analysis. This is normal. You have a backup, right?
